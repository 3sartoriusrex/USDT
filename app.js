//     body: "In a rare press event, President Trump has seemingly expressed sorrow and compassion to the Omaha Native American Tribe. In a viral video circulating social media, an Elder from the tribe is seen chanting and beating the drums to a healing song to diffuse a tense situation, when a youth from Covington Catholic presents him from continuing forward. The young man, identified as Nick Sandmann from Covington Catholic All Boys High School in Northern Kentucky, is seen with a smug smile, while classmates behind him jeer the Elder with chanting Trump 2020 and Make American Great Again. The group from Covington Catholic was attending a counter-protest during the Indigenous People's March at Lincoln Memorial. Nick Sandmann has issued a statement, which seems to mark each clichÃ©d phrase attemping to make him appear to be the good guy, a similar tactic now Supreme Courte Justice Kavanaugh used with some success."

President Trump has publicly scolded his agencies--CISA, a division in the Department of Homeland Security--for their lack of foresight or preparation, to which his Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra has rebuffed."

//     body: "In one of the most elaborate conspiracies to date, a group of scientists all over the world attempted to sow dissent and spread misinformation through a peer-reviewed channel, the journal Nature, about the causes and effects of global warming, now called climate change. The 'meta-study' claimed to have gathered opinions from 85% of the scientific community, including all realms of peer-reviewed science--the largest sample to date, if it had been true. They claimed to have interviewed scientists from fields of Paleoclimatology, Trans-primate Behavioral Economics, Biological Market Economics, and Underwater Basketweavery. THe results apparently showed a weak consensus on the nature causes, and effects of human-caused climate change, upturning the established concensus that climate change is, indeed, caused by humans."
